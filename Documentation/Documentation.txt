This website is made with Bootstrap and CSS.

My CSS is separated into two files: main.css and app.css

The main.css file is grouped into two sections:
  - One is the general(global) CSS typography,
  - The second one is my own CSS typography
   (here are included classes I created myself, that are used directly by the HTML file).

The app.css file is a converted Scss (Sass) file, meaning
the code is written in Scss then it is converted into Css.
The app.css is used as the dominant CSS file.

I used JavaScript only a little (in Html).

You will find 'Semantic Comments' when scrolling down my code,
which means the working sections of this website are divided
(Html comments of working sections are named the same as Scss comments).
I tried to be specific with my code so it will be easier for you as an editor to edit it.

All media queries are written inside the Scss file.

I've created the responsive design of the website for the following devices:

                                  1. Mobile
                                  2. Tablet
                                  3. Desktop
                                                :)
